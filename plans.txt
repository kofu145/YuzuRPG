# Yukime RPG!

Three states:
dungeon crawler
NPC text (can also be overworld based though, to make two)
battling

display ascii art in all

tile based system:
every tile is - (or empty) by default
press key to move wasd

you can name your character


# overworld
all maps are stored as text
converter from txt file to 2d char array

for each movement command, do a pre step check (check if going to be on a wall tile)
then do a post step check (check for things like warps, etc)

example map:
00000000
00111110
00100010
00112110
00000000

0 = nothing
1 = wall
2 = door

then associated collision map, where 0 is walkable and 1 is not
0 = walkable
1 = collision
2 = warp

warps - listed in a huge dictionary of warps - dictionary (likely json file)
{
	place:
	{
		[0, 0]: warptoplace
	}
}
